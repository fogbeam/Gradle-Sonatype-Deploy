Gradle Sonatype Deploy Plugin
==============================

This plugin automates the configuration of your project to use 
[Sonatype's Repositories](https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide), which
are a gateway for open source projects into Maven Central.
